# Notification preferences and deadline reminders

Depends on the English interface change. Open More → Settings → Configure notifications and reminders, or the extension options page. Choose desktop delivery, update notifications, immediate/daily delivery, a local daily time, and multiple deadline reminders. Save changes explicitly; Test notification checks browser delivery.

Desktop update delivery moves from the content-script announcement call to the background engine watching announcement/message storage. This is deliberately part of this notification feature; preceding UI/AI/language branches preserve the original call. Keeping both paths would duplicate desktop alerts.

The queue is processed every minute while the browser runs. Submitted, deleted, changed, and expired assignment deadlines are skipped. The first announcement/message snapshot is silent. Subsequent new items are queued, deduplicated, and retried on delivery failure. A disabled or unsupported desktop transport leaves sidebar alerts available. Safari's native notification transport is a separate follow-up.

## Validation

Run `node --test tests/*.test.cjs` and `node tests/notification-ui-smoke.cjs` with Playwright available. Repeat the browser fixture with `UI_LANGUAGE=zh-TW` and `SAFARI_FIXTURE=1` to check Chinese and unsupported APIs. Fixtures test dropdowns, timing, save status, responsive layout, deduplication, daily delivery, deadline cancellation, and retries. Actual OS banners and authenticated E3 updates require manual checks.
